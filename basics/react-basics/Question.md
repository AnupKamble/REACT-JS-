    - Cart page `(/cart)`
    - Orders page `(/orders)`

## Product page

    ```jsx
    [https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-products](https://dbioz2ek0e.execute-api.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/mockapi/get-products)
    ```
    
- You can find documentation here
    - Refer to **`GET`  Get all products with their price**
    
    ```jsx
    [https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9952810/VUjQmjcF](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/9952810/VUjQmjcF)
    ```
    
- Display these products in form of cards with following details
    - brand
    - title
    - image
    - category
    - price
- When clicking on any product, move user to product details page, more details about this page will be shown below.

- Note that filter and sort functionality should work together.
    - User should be able to sort according to filtered data.
